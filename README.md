# DatesData.cpp 

# ðŸ“… DateClass Tester - C++

This project demonstrates the usage of a custom `dateclass` in C++. It tests constructors, date manipulation methods, formatting outputs, and comparison between two dates.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Default and parameterized constructor for date objects
- Set and retrieve individual components (day, month, year)
- Standard format display (`MM/DD/YYYY`)
- Full format display (e.g., `July 15th, 2019`)
- Compare dates:
  - Check if two dates are the same
  - Check if one date is prior to another

## ðŸ§ª Sample Output
First date: 4/17/2018

Month of second date: 7

Second date (standard format): 7/15/2019

Second date (full format): July 15th, 2019

They are both different dates

First date is prior to the second date
